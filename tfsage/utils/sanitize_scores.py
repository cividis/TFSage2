    """
    Sanitize a pandas Series of scores by handling negative infinity values.

    This function replaces occurrences of negative infinity (-inf) in the input
    Series with the negative of the maximum absolute finite value in the Series.
    If no finite values are present, -inf is replaced with NaN.

    Args:
        scores (pd.Series): A pandas Series containing numeric scores, which may
            include negative infinity (-inf).

    Returns:
        pd.Series: A pandas Series with -inf values replaced by -max_abs_val,
        where max_abs_val is the maximum absolute finite value in the input Series.
